# Architecture

One contract: `storage.Event`. Collectors emit events; the store persists them;
diff/query/agent read them back. Nothing downstream of the store knows how an
event was collected.

## Pipeline

```
BPF data plane (collector.bpf.c) ──▶ ebpf control plane ──▶ collector ──▶ ingest ──▶ flushLoop ──▶ SQLite
  ringbuf submit                     load/attach/read         filter+drop    queue         chunk TX
```

| Stage | Package | Role |
|---|---|---|
| ABI | `internal/abi` | Handwritten `abi.yaml` plus generated schema/version constants, tracepoint table, and kernel-event header used by storage, CLI help, agent prompts, and BPF compilation. |
| Capture | `internal/ebpf` | Userspace **control plane**: load embedded BPF ELF, create maps, attach syscall/sched/block tracepoints, read the events ring buffer into `storage.Event`. In-kernel **data plane** is `collector.bpf.c`. Linux only; non-Linux stub errors. Rebuild with `make ebpf`. |
| Filter | `internal/collector` | Drop ignored path prefixes (userspace list; BPF only filters `/proc`/`/sys`/`/dev`). Bounded channel; overflow increments a dropped counter. |
| Queue + Batch | `internal/daemon` | Buffered `ingest` entrance queue decouples capture from SQLite. A confined `eventBatcher` (for-select) chunks by size or flush period into one transaction. On shutdown: cancel, **join the collector (producer)**, `close(ingest)`, then let flushLoop read to close and persist with a **fresh** context so the cancelled run ctx cannot abort the final write. |
| Store | `internal/storage` | SQLite (`modernc.org/sqlite`, no CGo). Daemon holds the only writer (`Open`, WAL, `MaxOpenConns(1)`). Every read path uses `OpenReadOnly` + `PRAGMA query_only=ON`. |

`Event.DroppedBefore` attributes kernel ring-buffer loss and collector overflow
to the next persisted row (additive; totals are `SUM(dropped_before)`).

## Reading

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `internal/diff` | Machine-state delta between two timestamps (processes, file mods, hot writers, sockets). |
| `internal/query` | Deterministic templates for common plain-English questions. |
| `internal/agent` | Optional external CLI (`LTM_AGENT` / `--agent`) that emits SQL; `ExtractSQL` keeps a single `SELECT`; always executed via read-only `RawSQL`. Failure → warn and fall back to templates. |
| CLI | `timeline` / `watch` / `query sql` go straight through `storage.Filter`, `EventsAfterID`, or `RawSQL`. |

`ltm benchmark` writes synthetic events through the store only — there is no
simulated collector.
